Meetups
-------

We have two active meetup groups (and one still forming), together forming the biggest Cleanweb group in the world, with over 600 members. We meet regularly for pub discussions and slightly more formal talk nights.

* [Cleanweb London](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London)
* [Cleanweb Scotland](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-Scotland)
* [Cleanweb Brighton](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-Brighton)

If you'd like to start a group in your area, please [get in touch](mailto:info@cleanweb.org.uk) and we'll help any way we can.
