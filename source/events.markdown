Meetups
-------

We have two active meetup groups, together forming the biggest Cleanweb group in the world, with over 330 members. We meet regularly for pub discussions and slightly more formal talk nights.

* [Cleanweb London](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London)
* [Cleanweb Scotland](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-Scotland)

We also have a small community starting up in [Brighton](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-Brighton). If you'd like to start a group in your area, please [get in touch](mailto:info@cleanweb.org.uk) and we'll help any way we can.
