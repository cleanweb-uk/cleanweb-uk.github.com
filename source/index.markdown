  Cleanweb is where cleantech meets the cloud; where sustainability meets social media.

<p>We have a big problem to solve, and the web is the fastest-moving tool we have.Whether you're building energy monitoring systems, helping people network around local food, or making the web itself greener,
if you're developing online tools for sustainability, you're part of the cleanweb. Glad to have you on board!</p>
<p>
If you're working on the cleanweb and want help, information, or just the knowledge that there's someone else
out there, <strong>Cleanweb UK</strong> is for you.
