Our next event is about how web technologies are helping to change how we consume energy.

### Schedule 

#### 7:00 - Introduction and community announcements


- [Dynamic Demand Challenge](http://dynamicdemand.nesta.org.uk/)

- [Connecting Homes Startup Competition](http://www.connectinghomes.co.uk/)

Got a request for help with your project? Looking to hire someone who gets the web, and sustainability?_

#### 7:20 -&nbsp;Data Science for Sustainability:&nbsp;[Joe Kwiatkowski](http://www.linkedin.com/in/joejk) - [EcoFactor](http://www.ecofactor.com/)

Data science is increasingly used to improve sustainability, for example improving the efficiency of the&nbsp;electrical grid, informing transport planning, and even reducing the methane emissions from livestock farming. I'll discuss the broad opportunities and challenges of data science in this context, and provide some specific examples the field of automated home energy management. Time permitting, I'll highlight some of the key companies that are in the field, both from Silicon Valley and beyond.

7:40 - Break for refreshments.

Refreshments generously provided by our hosts, Forward.

#### 8:00 -&nbsp;Reducing PC energy consumption:&nbsp;[James Singleton](http://unop.co.uk/) -&nbsp;[Shutdown Scanner](http://shutdownscanner.com/)

Reverse engineering an off the shelf home electricity monitor to log data to a Raspberry Pi, replacing PCs with lower power devices and using software to monitor computers left on when not needed._

#### 8:30 - Internet of Power:&nbsp;[James Johnston](https://twitter.com/digitalenergy53) - [Open Utility](http://www.openutility.co.uk/)

The current energy system was built in the late 19th century when distributed renewable energy and the Internet did not exist. My vision is to create a completely decentralised ‘Internet of Power’: a peer-to-peer energy network that enables individuals to source their electricity directly from power generators. The talk will suggest how this can be done and outline the technical and commercial challenges that lie ahead._

#### 9:00 Decamp to [BrewDog](http://www.brewdog.com/bars/camden)!
