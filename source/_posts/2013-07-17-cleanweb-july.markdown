This month, we're teaming up with the Internet of Things Meetup group, to run an IoT-themed meetup in the [suitably futuristic green-themed offices of Arup][], on [8 Fitzroy Street][].

## Schedule

#### 6:45 - Doors Open


#### 7:00 - Introduction and community announcements

What is the Internet of Things, and what is the Cleanweb, and why are they interesting together?

#### 7:10 - Community announcements

Got a request for help with your project? Looking to hire someone who gets the web, and sustainability?

Let us know at [info@cleanweb.org](mailto:info@cleanweb.org), and we'll help spread the word.

#### 7:20 - Demand Logic : Data mining to save energy in commercial buildings 
[Joe Short - Demand Logic](https://www.demandlogic.co.uk/)

Joe tells the story of the founding of Demand Logic and outlines some of their recent experience of using data mining, machine learning and visualisations to focus attention on massive energy wastage in commercial buildings.

#### 7:40 - Break for refreshments.

Refreshments generously provided by our hosts, Arup.

#### 8:00 - Working my way off the grid with my Rasberry Pi

[Steve Pike](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=38468260) and [Chris Elsmore](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=91442281) from [Carbon Culture](http://www.carbonculture.net/)

Chris and Steve tells the story of hatching a plan to use Raspberry Pis and cheap solar panels to get off the grid, one gadget at a time, and the pitfalls and pratfalls along the way.

#### 8:30 Sustainability and Transparency in an Internet of Things: Appending open data to physical things to foster more informed purchasing decisions.

[Jessi Baker](http://jessibaker.co.uk/) & [Matt Hussey](http://www.matthussey.co.uk/) from [Provenance](http://www.projectprovenance.com/). 

Provenance tells the true stories of products. It is a platform for transparency and it's built on open data. We believe revealing the truth about how something is made can help us buy better things, both for the environment and for societies near and far.

#### 9:00 Decamp to the pub!
