    <link href="http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/blog/2012/12/31/how-midata-will-fuel-uk-cleanweb-innovation/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-31T13:02:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/blog/2012/12/31/how-midata-will-fuel-uk-cleanweb-innovation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve mentioned before that we need to <a href="http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/blog/2012/10/09/mobilizing-developers-to-make-a-better-future/">experiment like crazy</a> to find solutions to to the planet scale problems we face as environmentally aware builders of the web. Midata is a scheme that could greatly ease the complexity of building services to help people live greener, more secure lives. After building a cleanweb app based around midata, then going to number 10 to talk with the policy wonks behind the scheme, here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>

<h1>What is midata?</h1>

<div style="float: right; margin: 10 15"><img src="http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/images/midata.png" alt="midata logo"></div>


<p>After a long period of gestation, 2013 should be the year that the government’s midata vision becomes reality. Midata is an initiative by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) to allow consumers access to the personal data that companies store about them in an electronic format. This personal data will include <strong>energy bills and usage data that the energy companies store</strong>, as well as financial information stored by banks and transactional data stored by retailers. The scheme will also allow consumers to <strong>share their information</strong> with compatible applications and websites.</p>

<h1>What are the benefits for consumers?</h1>

<p>For data geeks like us, easy access to our data in itself is a big win, but what are the benefits to the average consumer? Midata should make a whole host of services that up to now have been fairly niche more popular as they will be <strong>an order of magnitude easier to use</strong>. Many energy related services require consumers to input substantial amounts of information about their house and energy bills. This process is too much hassle for most people and is also error prone.</p>

<p>Midata will make this a relatively seamless process and make the results more accurate by retrieving the data directly from the energy companies APIs.  So instead of a consumer having to type in lots of information from their energy bills into a third party application or website, the consumer will be able to go to their energy supplier’s website and grant access to their energy bills and meter readings. A third party application or website will then be able to programmatically retrieve the relevant information from the energy company’s API.  Midata will enforce common data formats and standards ensuring that the process will work in the same consistent way regardless of which UK energy supplier the consumer uses.</p>

<h1>How might services we know work differently with midata?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Energy saving recommendations based on your personal energy usage. Website such as the <a href="http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/">Energy Saving Trust</a> offers this but it requires a lot of user input.</li>
<li>Collaborative and community applications that allow a group of people to compete with and help each other reduce their usage (such as <a href="http://opower.com/">Opower</a>)</li>
<li>Energy switching websites will be easier to use and more accurate</li>
<li>Website which produce estimates of the potential savings solar panels or new boilers make will be able to generate more accurate quotes</li>
<li>Benchmarking application will be able to monitor and report on the effectiveness of energy saving measures</li>
<li>An array of applications and websites delivering the real time information provide by the upcoming wave of smart meters</li>
<li>midata is about more than just energy! (see below for non energy examples)</li>
</ul>


<h1>The midata hackathon and emPowerMi</h1>

<div style="margin: 10px 15px; float: left"><img src="http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/images/midatahackthon.jpg" alt="Green button logo"></div>


<p>In November, we attended the <a href="http://www.theodi.org/events/midata-hackathon-2012">midata hackathon</a> at the <a href="http://www.theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a>. We helped develop an example website called <a href="http://empowermi.cleanweb.org.uk/">emPowerMi</a> to explore what midata can offer. The website summaries a consumer’s yearly energy usage and recommends some energy saving measures that are available.</p>

<p>There are already several websites that do similar things. However by accessing the consumer’s data directly we are able to provide instant recommendations and be more accurate.</p>

<h1>Green Button</h1>

<div style="margin: 0px 25px; float: right"><img src="http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/images/greenbutton.png" alt="Green button logo"></div>


<p>In September 2011 a similar initiative to midata was launched in the USA. Called <a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/">Green Button</a>, it has led to an explosion of new companies in the cleanweb space alongside widespread adoption by the energy companies. Hopefully with midata we can expect to see something similar happening in the UK.</p>

<h1>Midata’s wider remit</h1>

<p>The scope of data midata covers is much wider than just energy data, encompassing current and saving account transaction, credit cards, purchases and even travel history. At the midata hackathon we brainstormed some other potentially interesting cleanweb apps including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analysing your travel history and suggesting greener alternatives</li>
<li>Looking at your purchases and suggesting similar products that have a lower environmental impact (less fuel miles for example)</li>
<li>Comparing the returns on your savings accounts with the potential returns from Solar panels</li>
</ul>


<h1>Simple for developers and safe for consumers</h1>

<p>One of the biggest challenge in making midata a success will be balancing consumer’s privacy concerns while at the same time making it easy for developers to build applications and websites to access their data.</p>

<p>Hopefully the security restrictions on developers will also not be too onerous so that the barriers to entry can be kept low and innovation can flourish. Oauth seems like the obvious way to handle authentication, being familiar to both developers and consumers.</p>

<p>Taking on so many verticals (energy, banking, retail) at once will also be a challenge. Hopefully the standards for each vertical can be incrementally delivered to reduce risk and ensure that successful and useful uses of midata can be developed and demonstrated to the public.</p>

<h1>An exciting and important opportunity</h1>

<p>Midata should spur on lots of cleanweb innovation in the UK in 2013. By allowing consumers to share their data a whole host of useful websites and applications can be built and become popular. In turn this will help consumers reduce their energy usage and carbon emissions.</p>

<p>If you are developing online consumer products a whole range of ideas that have up to now not being practical due to consumer data being inaccessible will become possible. You can find out more about midata on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search?q=midata">gov.uk website</a> which has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/midata-company-briefing-pack">briefing pack</a> and an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/example-applications-of-the-midata-programme">overview of some potential applications</a>. A great way to get some early first hand experience is to attend a midata hackathon. Their should be more midata hackathons taking place in 2013. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=cleanwebuk">@cleanwebuk on twitter</a> or <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cleanweb-uk">join our mailing list</a> and we will keep you posted.</p>

    <updated>2012-10-09T11:10:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/blog/2012/10/09/mobilizing-developers-to-make-a-better-future</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have <a href="http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2012/09/arctic-sea-ice-extent-settles-at-record-seasonal-minimum/">a problem</a>, and we don&#8217;t yet a decent solution. As a species, we&#8217;re running lemming-like off a whole bunch of cliffs, of which climate change is just the biggest and nearest. At the same time, an enormous amount of human innovation is going into <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_17/b4225060960537.htm">making people click more ads</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a popular school of thought about climate change that says we don&#8217;t need to worry, because humanity always innovates its way out of a crisis. If that&#8217;s true, then <strong>we&#8217;d better get innovating right now</strong>, rather than waiting for others to do it, because we&#8217;re <strong>in the crisis</strong>. We need to <a href="http://www.forumforthefuture.org/blog/1000-100-10-1-why-we-need-experiment-crazy">experiment like crazy</a>, to try all the things that might help. Most will fail, as startups do, but if we try enough, something will work. If we can harness the kind of crazy innovation that&#8217;s created our modern web, we can do just about anything.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to think that software can&#8217;t fix anything <strong>real</strong>, but if you can write a line of code that saves someone energy, you leave a piece of coal unburnt. If you get someone out of their car and on a bus, you help take a fuel tanker off the road. In fact, I&#8217;m pretty sure that web software is the <strong>only</strong> thing we can scale quickly enough to make a serious difference in the time available.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;re a developer, maker, or innovator, and love a challenge, why not pick the one that really could change the world, and for the better? Sign the <a href="http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/manifesto.html">Cleanweb Manifesto</a>, and strike out on the biggest adventure of your life.</p>

<p>Cleanweb UK will be here to help you find a way to make your project sustainable, whether that&#8217;s finding a business or non-profit funding model, pointing you to people who can help, or just putting you in touch with like-minded friends you didn&#8217;t know you had.</p>

<p>Stop selling people to advertisers. <a href="http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/get_involved.html">Join us</a>, and let&#8217;s fix the future.</p>

    <id>http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/blog/2012/09/15/ignite-cleanweb-what-a-night</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday 13th September, we ran our first ever Ignite Cleanweb event, at a fantastic venue  generously provided by the lovely people at <a href="http://forwardtechnology.co.uk">Forward</a>.</p>

<p>And to put not too fine a point on it, it seems to have went far better than we dared hope - we wanted to showcase some of the best work happening at the intersection between sustainability and the web, and we had a clutch of speakers doing just that, showing how they were using the web to rethink mobility, mapping, and energy, food and supply chains to name a few of the talks on the night.</p>

<p>But don&#8217;t just take my word for it - we already <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/72550332/">have enough people saying nice things about the night</a> on the internet for us to feel pretty damn chuffed about the night already.</p>

<p>In particular, <a href="http://sustaination.co/2012/09/cleanweb-the-power-of-software-to-save-the-world/#">Ed Dowding (disclosure - one of the speakers on the night)</a> actually beat us to this post by a full day, and managed to say write something following the announcement of the Cleanweb Manifesto that we couldn&#8217;t help but quote here about the night:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s quite brilliant that the internet has come along just at the right time (albeit very much at the 11th hour). It is open, abundant, distributed. It mocks time and space. It brings people together to share and learn and change. It inspires, motivates, and empowers. It makes doing better easier. Of course it does not have all the solutions, but it mediates and sets the tone for many of them.</p>

<p>We are proud to be a part of it.</p>

<p>The presentations were also truly, deeply, brilliantly, emotionally, practically, socially inspiring.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you missed the event, or if you just fancy watching the talks again, you can watch them all on the <a href="http://igniteshow.com/events/ignite-cleanweb">Ignite website</a>, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUPaWd5mPJEGJK0vLva0AEvRIj35DKl2e">Youtube</a>, or right here:</p>

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLUPaWd5mPJEGJK0vLva0AEvRIj35DKl2e&amp;hl=en_US" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h3>Still want more?</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re feeling full of inspiration, and heading to the <a href="http://okfestival.org/">Open Knowledge Festival in Helsinki</a>, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/81444932/">cleanweb-themed Green Hackathon</a> taking place where you can see what others are doing, and hack on a project yourself.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you&#8217;re in London, you might also be interested in our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/81444932/">next social pub-meet</a>, at that Old Street startup stalwart, the Reliance.</p>

<p>See you there hopefully!</p>

    <link href="http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/blog/2012/09/11/the-growing-cleanweb-movement/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-11T21:23:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/blog/2012/09/11/the-growing-cleanweb-movement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a movement growing. Bit by bit, developers are using the power of the web to make our world more sustainable. Whether by improving the way we travel, the way we eat, or the way we use energy, the web is making a difference. The <a href="http://cleanweb.co">Cleanweb</a> movement is building a global conversation, with local chapters running hackdays and meetups to get people together all over the world.</p>

<p>Here in the UK, we&#8217;ve been doing this longer than anyone else. Cleanweb-style projects were emerging in 2007, with 2008&#8217;s <a href="https://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/geekyoto-aftermath/">geeKyoto</a> conference bringing together a lot of early efforts.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s only really appropriate then that we have the most active Cleanweb community in the world, in the form of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London">Cleanweb London</a>. With over 150 members, it&#8217;s a great base, on which we&#8217;re building a wider <a href="http://cleanweb.org.uk">Cleanweb UK</a> movement. We&#8217;ve run a <a href="http://london.greenhackathon.com">hackday</a>, have regular meetups, and are building towards our first <a href="http://cleanweb.org.uk/ignite.html">Ignite Cleanweb</a> evening in a couple of days&#8217; time.</p>

<p>This is an expanding community, made of many different projects and groups, and one that has a chance to do some real good. If you&#8217;d like to be part of it, or if you already are but didn&#8217;t know it, come along to a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London">meetup</a> and get involved!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s only a month until <a href='http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/ignite.html'>Ignite Cleanweb</a> hits London!</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve got 12 great talks lined up for you, covering the whole range of cleanweb activity in the UK. Learn how <a href='http://loco2.com'>Loco2</a> and <a href='http://whipcar.com'>WhipCar</a> are using the web to change the face of travel, or, if you fancy something more technical, how to write climate-friendly code and run it in a climate-friendly datacentre.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s happening the evening of Thursday 13th September, at <a href='http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/venue'>Forward Technology</a> in Camden. With great talks,
good conversation, and a few beers thrown in, it should be a night to remember.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/">Cleanweb UK</a> are excited to announce our first <a href="http://igniteshow.com/">Ignite</a> evening in London, hosted by <a href="http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/venue">Forward Technology</a> on <strong>Thursday 13th September 2012</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://igniteshow.com/">Ignite</a> is a geek event that has been held in over 100 cities worldwide. At the events, Ignite presenters share their personal and professional passions, using 20 slides that auto-advance every 15 seconds for a total of just five minutes. Add some beers and interesting conversation, and it should be a night to remember!</p>

<p>The main attraction, however, is YOU! If you&#8217;ve made <em>anything</em> on the web that has a sustainability aspect, let&#8217;s hear about it! Whether you want to talk about an old project, or a new idea that&#8217;s still written on a beermat, this is your opportunity to show off to and inspire a roomful of like-minded people.</p>

<p>If you want to present (and we hope you do), then let us know when you <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/72550332/">RSVP on Meetup</a> and, if you want, add yourself as a speaker on the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/ignite-cleanweb/">Lanyrd page</a>.</p>
