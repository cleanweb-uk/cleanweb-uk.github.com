    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here at Cleanweb UK, we&#8217;ve had quite a year. In <a href="">London</a>, we&#8217;ve run a great event every month, on topics as diverse as gaming and finance, and membership has almost reached 600. We&#8217;ve got a new group off the ground in <a href="">Scotland</a>, which has met a few times and had a successful collaboration with <a href="">Startup Weekend</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the end of the year is coming around, and so it&#8217;s time for something a bit special to celebrate such a great year!</p>

<h2>Lightning Talks</h2>

<p>Because of all of that, <a href="">Cleanweb London in December</a> will be a celebration of our brilliant community; we&#8217;ll be holding a lightning talks evening, and we want to hear from YOU. What&#8217;s your big idea? How are <em>you</em> going to change the world? Whether it&#8217;s something you&#8217;ve already done, something you want to make, or a way in which you&#8217;re doing things differently, we want you to come along and inspire your community.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re after 10 lightning talks, 5 minutes each maximum, and if you&#8217;ve never spoken in front of people before, don&#8217;t be scared - lightning talks are a great way into doing it. It doesn&#8217;t have to be technical, but if it&#8217;s about sustainability on the web, we want to hear about it!</p>

<p>Cleanweb London is on <a href="">16th December</a> (only two weeks away), so if you fancy speaking, get in touch via <a href="mailto:info@cleanweb.org.uk">email</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/cleanwebuk">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the event would be nothing without the audience, and we want it to be a big one, so go and sign up on the <a href="">Meetup page</a> right now and we&#8217;ll see you there!</p>

<h2>Sponsors</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re also looking for sponsors for the event to make it a bit more special, so if your company is interested in supporting our fantastic community, please get in touch.</p>

    <link href="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2013/09/27/where-cleanweb-and-startup-weekend-collide/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-27T17:37:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2013/09/27/where-cleanweb-and-startup-weekend-collide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div style="margin: 0px 15px; margin-bottom:10px; float: right"><img src="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/images/posts/sw_glasgow.png" alt="startup weekend glasgow"></div>


<p><em>Cleanweb is partnering with <a href="http://glasgow.startupweekend.org">Startup Weekend Glasgow</a> to host one of the very first sustainability-themed Startup Weekends on 25th October at <a href="http://www.citizenm.com/glasgow/societym">CitizenM, Glasgow</a>.</em></p>

<p>In recent years barriers to starting a business have lowered significantly. <a href="#democritizing">In a talk</a> presented at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, author and serial entrepreneur, Steve Blank, dubbed this change the ‘democratisation of entrepreneurship’. In it he discusses the various factors that have lead to this change, such as the cost and speed of product development. If you’ve got an hour it’s very much worth watching, if not, the first ten minutes outline his observations on the trend.</p>

<p>Technology has had a massive part to play in these changes. The Internet has given us reach to greater markets and as incredible as it may seem it is still growing enormously. The ‘open source’ movement now applies to hardware as much software, making it easier for us to prototype physical products. The aid of fabrication labs and hacker-spaces such as <a href="http://www.maklab.co.uk/">Glasgow’s own Maklab</a> (also <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maklablondon/maklab-london-open-access-digital-fabrication">opening in London</a>) mean you don’t need to own everything to realise your creations. Once you’ve finished product development, small-batch manufacturers like <a href="http://ponoko.com">Ponoko.com</a>, mean you don’t need to order your stock in the hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>Aside from the entrepreneurship’s new ‘pull factor’, many of us are feeling a ‘push factor’ too. Since the economic crash of 2008 the numbers of self-employed have increased enormously.</p>

<p style = "padding-left:1em; margin-top:1.5em; margin-bottom:1.5em;">

“According to official figures, the number of self-employed people in the UK has risen 374,000 since the start of the financial crisis, reaching 4.2 million in April this year.” – <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22845051">BBC News</a>

</p>


<p>Questionable job security has shifted perspective on the risks of business start-up. Consider a recent graduate faced with a low or unpaid internship. A year spent on a venture (even if it fails) holds far more potential and reward.</p>

<p>With new means at our disposal many of us are aiming to carve out prosperous and resilient futures. A large part of that future prosperity depends on how we treat our planet. Unfortunately, environmental decision making has mostly been a top down affair. Much like starting a business was, involving the few rather than the many.</p>

<p>That’s where the Cleanweb movement comes in. We believe the democratisation of entrepreneurship, increases in technology and innovation can be applied to drive massive changes in sustainability. You don’t need to be a venture capitalist, the head of an NGO, or a hydrogen fuel cell specialist. Your idea to make the walk to work more fun (and drive business to a cafe along the way) could be in the hands of thousands of people. You’d be responsible for reducing greenhouse gases, improving air quality, and perhaps save the high street while you’re at it.</p>

<p>*The best ideas are the simplest, whether it’s making <a href="http://loco2.com">continental rail travel easier</a>, or helping people make decisions about <a href="http://sustainablejohn.com/?p=400">which appliance to buy</a>. We’ll be talking about this, <a href="http://glasgow.startupweekend.org">Startup Weekend</a>, and more at the next <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-Scotland">Cleanweb Meetup in Glasgow</a> on 3rd October, and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London">in London</a> on 21st October.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our next event is about how web technologies are helping to change how we consume energy.</p>

<h3>Schedule</h3>

<h4>7:00 - Introduction and community announcements</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://dynamicdemand.nesta.org.uk/">Dynamic Demand Challenge</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.connectinghomes.co.uk/">Connecting Homes Startup Competition</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Got a request for help with your project? Looking to hire someone who gets the web, and sustainability?_</p>

<p>Let us know at <a href="mailto:info@cleanweb.org.uk">info@cleanweb.org.uk</a>, and we&#8217;ll help spread the word._</p>

<h4>7:20 -&nbsp;Data Science for Sustainability:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joejk">Joe Kwiatkowski</a> - <a href="http://www.ecofactor.com/">EcoFactor</a></h4>

<p>Data science is increasingly used to improve sustainability, for example improving the efficiency of the&nbsp;electrical grid, informing transport planning, and even reducing the methane emissions from livestock farming. I&#8217;ll discuss the broad opportunities and challenges of data science in this context, and provide some specific examples the field of automated home energy management. Time permitting, I&#8217;ll highlight some of the key companies that are in the field, both from Silicon Valley and beyond.</p>

<p>7:40 - Break for refreshments.</p>

<p>Refreshments generously provided by our hosts, Forward.</p>

<h4>8:00 -&nbsp;Reducing PC energy consumption:&nbsp;<a href="http://unop.co.uk/">James Singleton</a> -&nbsp;<a href="http://shutdownscanner.com/">Shutdown Scanner</a></h4>

<p>Reverse engineering an off the shelf home electricity monitor to log data to a Raspberry Pi, replacing PCs with lower power devices and using software to monitor computers left on when not needed.</p>

<h4>8:30 - Internet of Power:&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/digitalenergy53">James Johnston</a> - <a href="http://www.openutility.co.uk/">Open Utility</a></h4>

<p>The current energy system was built in the late 19th century when distributed renewable energy and the Internet did not exist. My vision is to create a completely decentralised ‘Internet of Power’: a peer-to-peer energy network that enables individuals to source their electricity directly from power generators. The talk will suggest how this can be done and outline the technical and commercial challenges that lie ahead.</p>

    <link href="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2013/04/29/the-cleanweb-story/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-29T06:30:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2013/04/29/the-cleanweb-story</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We often get asked: &#8220;What is this cleanweb thing then?&#8221;, and the answer is usually different depending on who you ask. If I had to summarise it myself though (which I do), it would be something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Cleanweb innovators use web technology to fight climate change, and build a more sustainable and resilient future.</p></blockquote>

<p>Obviously this glosses over a great many things; just for one, climate change is simply the largest and most pressing of a number of environmental challenges, many of which cleanweb ideas could be applied to.</p>

<p>The fundamental thinking is this though: as technologists, we have incredibly powerful tools at our disposal, and we can use them to help solve the most challenging problems of our times. By doing so, we can make the future a better, smarter, safer place to be for everyone.</p>

<p>Cleanweb doesn&#8217;t imply a particular type of solution, or include political judgements on what that future should look like (though of course we all do as individuals). If a startup can cut emissions by making private aviation more efficient, that&#8217;s just as valid as another one helping build local food co-operatives.</p>

<p>So what does a cleanweb future look like?</p>

<p>Well, as I&#8217;ve said, the exact shape of the future is unknown; we&#8217;ll all find our way there together.</p>

<p>However, I believe that web technologies will be a vital component in the inevitable transition to sustainability, and cleanweb will be right in the middle of it. Over the next few years, I hope we will see a flowering of innovation, with thousands of cleanweb projects getting off the ground, trying to make a difference.</p>

<p>Most will fail, but a few will succeed, and a couple might just change the world. Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool to be one of them?</p>

    <link href="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2013/04/21/moving-from-heroku-to-the-clean-cloud/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-21T16:31:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2013/04/21/moving-from-heroku-to-the-clean-cloud</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have been building a new website for <a href="http://www.repowering.org.uk">Repowering</a> - a co-operative focused on radically increasing the number of renewable energy projects in London. Last weekend I migrated the website from <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> to <a href="http://www.greenqloud.com">GreenQloud</a>.</p>

<h1>Whats wrong with Heroku?</h1>

<p>When I started building the new Repowering website I initially hosted it on Heroku. I am a big Heroku fan. It makes it super easy to get a Ruby website on the web. However there is a downside to Heroku - it runs on top of Amazon&#8217;s EC2 cloud computing platform which means it is <strong>powered by dirty CO<sub>2</sub> spurting coal power plants</strong> (check out <a href="https://www.mastodonc.com/dashboard">MastondonC&#8217;s dashboard of cloud provider CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a> to see for yourself). One of Repowering&#8217;s aims is to reduce carbon emissions, so having a website that produced unnecessary emissions was a big no no.</p>

<h1>Moving to Greenqloud</h1>

<div style="margin: 0px 15px; margin-bottom:10px; float: right"><img src="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/images/posts/greenqloud-logo-small.png" alt="Greenqloud logo"></div>


<p>There is a greener solution - the Icelandic company Greenqloud offer cloud hosting based in Iceland. As Iceland&#8217;s electricity system runs on geothermal and hydro power the server emissions are as close to zero carbon as you can get. Cost wise it&#8217;s comparable too. While Heroku is free for a single dyno, costs escalate rapidly as you start adding workers and features such as SSL.</p>

<h1>Setting up the Virtual Machine for Rails</h1>

<p><img src="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/images/posts/greenqloud-dashboard.png" alt="Greenqloud dashboard"></p>

<p>Greenqloud has an easy to use interface. It&#8217;s a few clicks to setup a new box and you get a browser based VNC client to do your initial configuration. Unlike Heroku however you need to setup the platform yourself. For something like Wordpress this is <a href="http://support.greenqloud.com/entries/22163871-Getting-started-with-GreenQloud-Part-1">quick and easy</a>, but for the Ruby on Rails application its a bit more involved. I spent 2 or 3 hours installing Ruby, Mongo, Redis, Nginx and configuring Unicorn and SSH.</p>

<p>I followed these guides for help setting up the server:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ghosttx.com/2013/02/fast-reliable-production-rails-3-web-server-on-ubuntu-nginx-passenger/">How To Easily Build a Fast, Reliable Production Rails 3.2 Web Server with Ubuntu 12.10 / Nginx / Passenger</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sirupsen.com/setting-up-unicorn-with-nginx/">Setting up Unicorn with Nginx</a></li>
<li><a href="http://greenqloud.com/quick-tips-on-security/">Quick tips on security</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If you are a devops wizard you could use Chef or Puppet to do automate this. The other task you need to handle yourself is backup. I knocked together a little script based on <a href="https://github.com/billturner/simple-s3-backup">this to handle backups</a>.</p>

<h1>Towards a cleaner cloud</h1>

<p>From a price and time perspective it hasn&#8217;t cost me much to move to a low carbon hosting platform. Its an easy way to reduce your client&#8217;s or organisation&#8217;s carbon emissions. To realise cloud computing&#8217;s green potential we need to make cloud computing low carbon by default. Here are some ways cloud infrastructure can become greener:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon EC2 could start running their infrastructure on low carbon electricity. Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook have recently started to move in this direction.</li>
<li>Services such as Heroku could have more flexibility over where your applications run</li>
<li>More Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider need to support green cloud providers</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2013/03/17/open-weather-data/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-17T16:31:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2013/03/17/open-weather-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What would you build if you had access to all the UK&#8217;s weather historical weather data?</p>

<p>The Open Data User Group are currently building a case for getting the Met Office to open up all their historical weather data for anyone to use, but they need your help! Because opening this up will cost money, they need to get an idea of what people will use it for.</p>

<p>As Cleanweb UK, we wholeheartedly support the release of this information. We can see a number of interesting ways in which it could be used:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enabling analysis of energy use patterns</strong>: Developers could prove the increase in efficiency of homes after insulation by looking at energy use before and after; weather information is an essential part of this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visualising our changing climate</strong>: The UK&#8217;s weather is getting stranger, or so it seems. With access to actual data, developers could make this visible to the public in a variety of ways.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Small-scale renewable planning</strong>: With access to more detailed data around wind patterns and sun exposure, applications could help people interested in microgeneration to predict future performance more accurately.</p></li>

<p><em><a href="http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/blog/2012/10/09/mobilizing-developers-to-make-a-better-future/">The call to action</a> for entrepreneurs and developers is being heard ever further. The 22nd March will see <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-Scotland/">the first Cleanweb meetup</a> in Scotland at Glasgow&#8217;s CCA.</em></p>

<p>In terms of clean-tech, Scotland is a busy place, especially owing to the rich potential of renewable resources in the country. 12 out of Scotland’s 14 universities are engaged in clean-tech research and centres of innovation such as the ECCI provide a hub for this research to reach market market and impact the real world. Recently, the ECCI saw the launch of the Green Tech Meetup, an informal gathering of entrepreneurs and investors.</p>

<p>Politically, energy and environment are devolved issues. This means policies are legislated from Holyrood rather than Westminster. Of note, is the 2009 <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/12/contents">Climate Change Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Environment/waste-and-pollution/Waste-1/wastestrategy">Zero Waste Plan</a>. The Climate Change Act has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, with an interim reduction target of 42% for 2020. The Zero Waste plan set a target of 70% recycling and composting for all waste and a maximum of 5% sent to landfill, both by 2025.</p>

<p>Institutions aside, there are great examples of grass-roots initiatives driving change. Most inspiring, is the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigg#Isle_of_Eigg_Heritage_Trust">the Isle of Eigg</a>. After a community land buy-out, the islanders got to setting up their own electricity grid which is 90% powered from renewable sources.</p>

<p>Like anywhere else in the world, there are still significant barriers to achieving a sustainable society. In the past 10 years, investors in the clean-tech space have become more risk averse and the economic crash hasn&#8217;t helped either. It&#8217;s also becoming clearer the extent to which systematic and behavioural change are also required.</p>

<p>Even if you don&#8217;t believe in the &#8216;techno-fix&#8217; (the idea that technology will save us), it&#8217;s hard to argue technology doesn&#8217;t shape our behaviour. Consider how much the internet has shaped behaviour in the past ten years. What could happen in the next ten? Taking this into account, it seems as though digital solutions have hardly been put on the menu.</p>

<p>Locally, there is plenty of technical talent to tackle these challenges. The presence of home-grown companies such as <a href="https://www.ewgeco.com/">Ewgeco</a>, <a href="http://www.freeagent.com/">FreeAgent</a>, <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net/">Skyscanner</a> as well as big names such as Amazon, NCR, and Rockstar show there&#8217;s a healthy community of technically skilled people out there. Many of whom are becoming involved in hacking for social good. Very shortly we&#8217;ll see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_Day">hack-days</a> in <a href="http://learnerjourneydatajam.com/">education</a> and <a href="http://www.nhshackscotland.org.uk/">health</a>. Meanwhile, the activities of the local <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/category/events/okscotland/">Open Knowledge group</a> are connecting the grass-roots with larger institutions.</p>

<p>Encouraging surroundings for our new Cleanweb group. If you&#8217;d like to find out more or get involved <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-Scotland/">join us on the 22nd</a>!</p>

    <id>http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2013/02/28/the-promise-and-the-perils-of-efficiency</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div style="margin: 0px 15px; float: right"><img src="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/images/posts/ICT4S-and-zurich-small.png" alt="ICT4S Keynote"></div>


<p><em>Two Cleanweb UK team members, <a href="https://twitter.com/JackTownsend_">Jack Townsend</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonneylon">Jason Neylon</a>, attended the <a href="http://www.ict4s.org/">First International Conference on ICT for Sustainability</a> (ICT4S 2013) in Zurich recently. Here is the first in a series of posts about the big themes presented at the conference.</em></p>

<p>Efficiency was the dominant theme of ICT4S2013. In his opening keynote, US efficiency guru <a href="http://aceee.org/node/97">John Laitner</a> hailed a <em>third industrial revolution</em>, as the emergence of interactive communications and distributed clean energy bring unprecedented <em>intelligent efficiency</em>. The conference brought together an impressive community of academics and industry player working towards this goal of make everything more efficient with ICTs. So with all this good work, we can expect some major reductions of our impact on the environment, right? Well, there&#8217;s a catch.</p>

<h2>Can ICT help decouple economic growth from resource use?</h2>

<div style="margin: 10px 15px; float: right"><img src="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/images/posts/ict4s-keynote.jpeg" alt="ICT4S Keynote"></div>


<p>Firstly we were asked by <a href="https://twitter.com/jcmankoff">Jennifer Mankoff</a>: how big are the reductions we can really expect, and are they enough? Alice Valvodova offered an optimistic assessment in the <a href="https://twitter.com/GeSIConnect">GESI</a> <a href="http://gesi.org/SMARTer2020">Smarter 2020 report</a>, with a 16% reduction possible by 2020. This would counter expected rises in global energy use, but wouldn&#8217;t make much of a dent in existing emissions. Historically, efficiency gains have apparently delivered much, but still haven&#8217;t kept up with economic growth; John Laitner asserted that something like 75% of new demand for energy-related goods had been met with efficiency gains since 1970. He sees efficiency as an economic imperative: inefficiency creates costs which constrain economic activity, whilst energy efficiency is correlated with the productivity of the economy.</p>

<p>Laitner called for efficiency gains to be pushed to 1% more than the rate of economic growth. The question is: is this fast enough to go beyond promoting economic growth to begin the massive challenge of decoupling economic activity from our impact on an overstretched environment? Can the third industrial revolution be any kinder to environment than the first two?</p>

<h2>Faster and faster</h2>

<p>This tension between the economic and environmental benefits of efficiency leads us on to the second problem, a real humdinger: <strong>creating greater efficiency in individual processes often doesn&#8217;t lead to reductions in overall resource use</strong>, otherwise known as the <em>rebound effect</em>. In its worst guise, the <em>Jevons paradox</em>, it is found that the economic growth arising from such efficiency can massively increase overall use of the resource. Consider, for example, the great increase in demand for ICTs themselves, as Moore&#8217;s law has made them exponentially more efficient and thus cheaper.</p>

<div style="margin: 10px 15px; float: right"><img src="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/images/posts/spreng-triangle.png" alt="Spreng's Triangle"></div>


<p>These tensions are neatly mapped out on the <em>Spreng Triangle</em>, which places industries and process according to their relative use of three fundamental ingredients: energy (a proxy for environmental impact), information (a product of ICT), and time (a proxy for money). Daniel Spreng explained how research from the 80s into implementing ICTs in the textile industry had shown that they brought greater efficiency of energy use, but that they also allowed processes to be run faster, increasing energy use, and - given the choice in a world of cheap energy - it makes economic sense to use the ICTs to speed everything up and use more energy than maintain the original speed and save energy.</p>

<p>This led to some philosophical banter around the &#8220;hamster wheel&#8221; of modernity in which we run and run, faster and faster. So, are we mice or men? (The prospect was raised of escaping the &#8220;rat race&#8221; for a future slow <a href="http://www.greenhackathon.com">Green Hackathon</a> in a Swedish forest.) Moreover, there are also social impacts of this speeding up via efficiency: Spreng highlights that ICTs</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;although very suitable to pushing economic growth, often contributes to growth by saving labor.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2>A wicked problem</h2>

<p>I had come to the conference partly to learn more about this conundrum of rebound, and wasn&#8217;t disappointed. The challenges of the rebound effect emerge from the difficulty of realising and even measuring change in a complex, non-linear and socio-technical world.</p>

<blockquote><p>If we create a particular piece of software or hardware, what sort of effects can we expect and how will we know if they are good or bad for the environment?</p></blockquote>

<div style="margin: 10px 15px; float: right"><img src="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/images/posts/wicked-things.png" alt="Wicked things drawing"></div>


<p>In his keynote, conference organizer Lorenz Hilty described his model of the impact of ICT on sustainability that separates first, second and third order effects. Whilst first order &#8220;direct&#8221; effects of the creation, use and disposal of the equipment can be reasonably well understood, things become more challenging when we start to analyse the second order effects of how we use it, and can become so complex as to be beyond practical measurement when we consider the myriad systematic third order effects, as complex human behaviours, economies and politics adapt to the presence of the technology. Thus introducing a very high power videoconferencing system may increase energy use in server farms (largely measurable first order effects), allow substitution of business travel, saving energy (second order effects), but by allowing people to develop longer distance relationships it could eventually lead to more long plane trips (third order effects, much more challenging to measure). And what further subtle implications for resource use could videoconferencing, have as the pattern of human relationships change? If we try and assess this system where do we set the boundaries of our model? Everything outside will be unmeasured and thus ignored.</p>

<p>Jennifer Mankoff called on the community to</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;define the metrics for success and the breadth of topics that fit within the goal of reducing energy use and, more generally, increasing worldwide sustainability;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>to look beyond just the individual and their own device to the big wide world. But of course that world is a big complex place; we begin to see why sustainability has been called a super-wicked problem, where many factors limit the success of attempts to deal with it.</p>

<h2>So what can we do about it?</h2>

<p>So how can we tackle these infernal rebound effects? What does the ICT for sustainability community require to fulfil the exciting potential to mitigate our environmental impact? This pervading question remained at the margins of the conference, as it raises many challenges from economics and politics rather than classic IT. This is understandable, but it seems that the ICT4S community has an important role to play in feeding into conversations with policy makers and social scientists about the legal and economic framework needed to drive climate-friendly innovation, and reductions in overall resource use.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Techno-fixes&#8221; <em>alone</em> are unlikely to reduce our impact.</p></blockquote>

<p>Visions such as that of the GESI Smarter 2020 report - which do not consider rebound effects - have a useful political role to play in detailing what could be possible, as well as creating a program of priorities for ICT4S deployment. However, without political and economic incentives towards limiting overall resource use, the environmental benefits of efficency may be considerably smaller than we hope. So what forms could these incentives take? That&#8217;s for another blog post, but there are suggestions in this recent <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/pdf/rebound_effect_report.pdf">European Commission report</a>, along with lots more about on that perfidious rebound effect.</p>

    <link href="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2012/12/31/how-midata-will-fuel-uk-cleanweb-innovation/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-31T13:02:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2012/12/31/how-midata-will-fuel-uk-cleanweb-innovation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve mentioned before that we need to <a href="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2012/10/09/mobilizing-developers-to-make-a-better-future/">experiment like crazy</a> to find solutions to to the planet scale problems we face as environmentally aware builders of the web. Midata is a scheme that could greatly ease the complexity of building services to help people live greener, more secure lives. After building a cleanweb app based around midata, then going to number 10 to talk with the policy wonks behind the scheme, here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>

<h1>What is midata?</h1>

<div style="float: right; margin: 10 15"><img src="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/images/midata.png" alt="midata logo"></div>


<p>After a long period of gestation, 2013 should be the year that the government’s midata vision becomes reality. Midata is an initiative by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) to allow consumers access to the personal data that companies store about them in an electronic format. This personal data will include <strong>energy bills and usage data that the energy companies store</strong>, as well as financial information stored by banks and transactional data stored by retailers. The scheme will also allow consumers to <strong>share their information</strong> with compatible applications and websites.</p>

<h1>What are the benefits for consumers?</h1>

<p>For data geeks like us, easy access to our data in itself is a big win, but what are the benefits to the average consumer? Midata should make a whole host of services that up to now have been fairly niche more popular as they will be <strong>an order of magnitude easier to use</strong>. Many energy related services require consumers to input substantial amounts of information about their house and energy bills. This process is too much hassle for most people and is also error prone.</p>

<p>Midata will make this a relatively seamless process and make the results more accurate by retrieving the data directly from the energy companies APIs.  So instead of a consumer having to type in lots of information from their energy bills into a third party application or website, the consumer will be able to go to their energy supplier’s website and grant access to their energy bills and meter readings. A third party application or website will then be able to programmatically retrieve the relevant information from the energy company’s API.  Midata will enforce common data formats and standards ensuring that the process will work in the same consistent way regardless of which UK energy supplier the consumer uses.</p>

<h1>How might services we know work differently with midata?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Energy saving recommendations based on your personal energy usage. Website such as the <a href="http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/">Energy Saving Trust</a> offers this but it requires a lot of user input.</li>
<li>Collaborative and community applications that allow a group of people to compete with and help each other reduce their usage (such as <a href="http://opower.com/">Opower</a>)</li>
<li>Energy switching websites will be easier to use and more accurate</li>
<li>Website which produce estimates of the potential savings solar panels or new boilers make will be able to generate more accurate quotes</li>
<li>Benchmarking application will be able to monitor and report on the effectiveness of energy saving measures</li>
<li>An array of applications and websites delivering the real time information provide by the upcoming wave of smart meters</li>
<li>midata is about more than just energy! (see below for non energy examples)</li>
</ul>


<h1>The midata hackathon and emPowerMi</h1>

<div style="margin: 10px 15px; float: left"><img src="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/images/midatahackthon.jpg" alt="Midata hackathon"></div>


<p>In November, we attended the <a href="http://www.theodi.org/events/midata-hackathon-2012">midata hackathon</a> at the <a href="http://www.theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a>. We helped develop an example website called <a href="http://empowermi.cleanweb.org.uk/">emPowerMi</a> to explore what midata can offer. The website summaries a consumer’s yearly energy usage and recommends some energy saving measures that are available.</p>

<p>There are already several websites that do similar things. However by accessing the consumer’s data directly we are able to provide instant recommendations and be more accurate.</p>

<h1>Green Button</h1>

<div style="margin: 0px 25px; float: right"><img src="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/images/greenbutton.png" alt="Green button logo"></div>


<p>In September 2011 a similar initiative to midata was launched in the USA. Called <a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/">Green Button</a>, it has led to an explosion of new companies in the cleanweb space alongside widespread adoption by the energy companies. Hopefully with midata we can expect to see something similar happening in the UK.</p>

<h1>Midata’s wider remit</h1>

<p>The scope of data midata covers is much wider than just energy data, encompassing current and saving account transaction, credit cards, purchases and even travel history. At the midata hackathon we brainstormed some other potentially interesting cleanweb apps including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analysing your travel history and suggesting greener alternatives</li>
<li>Looking at your purchases and suggesting similar products that have a lower environmental impact (less fuel miles for example)</li>
<li>Comparing the returns on your savings accounts with the potential returns from Solar panels</li>
</ul>


<h1>Simple for developers and safe for consumers</h1>

<p>One of the biggest challenge in making midata a success will be balancing consumer’s privacy concerns while at the same time making it easy for developers to build applications and websites to access their data.</p>

<p>Hopefully the security restrictions on developers will also not be too onerous so that the barriers to entry can be kept low and innovation can flourish. Oauth seems like the obvious way to handle authentication, being familiar to both developers and consumers.</p>

<p>Taking on so many verticals (energy, banking, retail) at once will also be a challenge. Hopefully the standards for each vertical can be incrementally delivered to reduce risk and ensure that successful and useful uses of midata can be developed and demonstrated to the public.</p>

<h1>An exciting and important opportunity</h1>

<p>Midata should spur on lots of cleanweb innovation in the UK in 2013. By allowing consumers to share their data a whole host of useful websites and applications can be built and become popular. In turn this will help consumers reduce their energy usage and carbon emissions.</p>

<p>If you are developing online consumer products a whole range of ideas that have up to now not being practical due to consumer data being inaccessible will become possible. You can find out more about midata on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search?q=midata">gov.uk website</a> which has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/midata-company-briefing-pack">briefing pack</a> and an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/example-applications-of-the-midata-programme">overview of some potential applications</a>. A great way to get some early first hand experience is to attend a midata hackathon. Their should be more midata hackathons taking place in 2013.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s soon time for Cleanweb London&#8217;s monthly meeting, and this month we&#8217;re trying something a little different. After the success of our <a href="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/ignite.html">Ignite Cleanweb</a> event in September, we&#8217;ve decided to try putting on more talks.</p>

<p>So, we&#8217;re excited to announce our first talk night on 19th November, 7pm at the <a href="http://theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a>. We&#8217;ve got three great speakers lined up who are going to talk about cloud computing and its environmental impact:</p>

    <id>http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2012/10/09/mobilizing-developers-to-make-a-better-future</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have <a href="http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2012/09/arctic-sea-ice-extent-settles-at-record-seasonal-minimum/">a problem</a>, and we don&#8217;t yet a decent solution. As a species, we&#8217;re running lemming-like off a whole bunch of cliffs, of which climate change is just the biggest and nearest. At the same time, an enormous amount of human innovation is going into <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_17/b4225060960537.htm">making people click more ads</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a popular school of thought about climate change that says we don&#8217;t need to worry, because humanity always innovates its way out of a crisis. If that&#8217;s true, then <strong>we&#8217;d better get innovating right now</strong>, rather than waiting for others to do it, because we&#8217;re <strong>in the crisis</strong>. We need to <a href="http://www.forumforthefuture.org/blog/1000-100-10-1-why-we-need-experiment-crazy">experiment like crazy</a>, to try all the things that might help. Most will fail, as startups do, but if we try enough, something will work. If we can harness the kind of crazy innovation that&#8217;s created our modern web, we can do just about anything.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to think that software can&#8217;t fix anything <strong>real</strong>, but if you can write a line of code that saves someone energy, you leave a piece of coal unburnt. If you get someone out of their car and on a bus, you help take a fuel tanker off the road. In fact, I&#8217;m pretty sure that web software is the <strong>only</strong> thing we can scale quickly enough to make a serious difference in the time available.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;re a developer, maker, or innovator, and love a challenge, why not pick the one that really could change the world, and for the better? Sign the <a href="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/manifesto.html">Cleanweb Manifesto</a>, and strike out on the biggest adventure of your life.</p>

<p>Cleanweb UK will be here to help you find a way to make your project sustainable, whether that&#8217;s finding a business or non-profit funding model, pointing you to people who can help, or just putting you in touch with like-minded friends you didn&#8217;t know you had.</p>

<p>Stop selling people to advertisers. <a href="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/get_involved.html">Join us</a>, and let&#8217;s fix the future.</p>

    <link href="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2012/09/15/ignite-cleanweb-what-a-night/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-15T23:14:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2012/09/15/ignite-cleanweb-what-a-night</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday 13th September, we ran our first ever Ignite Cleanweb event, at a fantastic venue  generously provided by the lovely people at <a href="http://forwardtechnology.co.uk">Forward</a>.</p>

<p>And to put not too fine a point on it, it seems to have went far better than we dared hope - we wanted to showcase some of the best work happening at the intersection between sustainability and the web, and we had a clutch of speakers doing just that, showing how they were using the web to rethink mobility, mapping, and energy, food and supply chains to name a few of the talks on the night.</p>

<p>But don&#8217;t just take my word for it - we already <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/72550332/">have enough people saying nice things about the night</a> on the internet for us to feel pretty damn chuffed about the night already.</p>

<p>In particular, <a href="http://sustaination.co/2012/09/cleanweb-the-power-of-software-to-save-the-world/#">Ed Dowding (disclosure - one of the speakers on the night)</a> actually beat us to this post by a full day, and managed to say write something following the announcement of the Cleanweb Manifesto that we couldn&#8217;t help but quote here about the night:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s quite brilliant that the internet has come along just at the right time (albeit very much at the 11th hour). It is open, abundant, distributed. It mocks time and space. It brings people together to share and learn and change. It inspires, motivates, and empowers. It makes doing better easier. Of course it does not have all the solutions, but it mediates and sets the tone for many of them.</p>

<p>We are proud to be a part of it.</p>

<p>The presentations were also truly, deeply, brilliantly, emotionally, practically, socially inspiring.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you missed the event, or if you just fancy watching the talks again, you can watch them all on the <a href="http://igniteshow.com/events/ignite-cleanweb">Ignite website</a>, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUPaWd5mPJEGJK0vLva0AEvRIj35DKl2e">Youtube</a>, or right here:</p>

<h3>Still want more?</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re feeling full of inspiration, and heading to the <a href="http://okfestival.org/">Open Knowledge Festival in Helsinki</a>, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/81444932/">cleanweb-themed Green Hackathon</a> taking place where you can see what others are doing, and hack on a project yourself.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you&#8217;re in London, you might also be interested in our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/81444932/">next social pub-meet</a>, at that Old Street startup stalwart, the Reliance.</p>

<p>See you there hopefully!</p>

    <link href="http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2012/09/11/the-growing-cleanweb-movement/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-11T21:23:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://cleanweb-uk.github.com/blog/2012/09/11/the-growing-cleanweb-movement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a movement growing. Bit by bit, developers are using the power of the web to make our world more sustainable. Whether by improving the way we travel, the way we eat, or the way we use energy, the web is making a difference. The <a href="http://cleanweb.co">Cleanweb</a> movement is building a global conversation, with local chapters running hackdays and meetups to get people together all over the world.</p>

<p>Here in the UK, we&#8217;ve been doing this longer than anyone else. Cleanweb-style projects were emerging in 2007, with 2008&#8217;s <a href="https://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/geekyoto-aftermath/">geeKyoto</a> conference bringing together a lot of early efforts.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s only really appropriate then that we have the most active Cleanweb community in the world, in the form of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London">Cleanweb London</a>. With over 150 members, it&#8217;s a great base, on which we&#8217;re building a wider <a href="http://cleanweb.org.uk">Cleanweb UK</a> movement. We&#8217;ve run a <a href="http://london.greenhackathon.com">hackday</a>, have regular meetups, and are building towards our first <a href="http://cleanweb.org.uk/ignite.html">Ignite Cleanweb</a> evening in a couple of days&#8217; time.</p>

<p>This is an expanding community, made of many different projects and groups, and one that has a chance to do some real good. If you&#8217;d like to be part of it, or if you already are but didn&#8217;t know it, come along to a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London">meetup</a> and get involved!</p>
