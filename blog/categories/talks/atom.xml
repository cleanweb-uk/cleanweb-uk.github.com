<p>So, we're excited to announce our first talk night on 19th November, 7pm at the <a href="http://theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a>. We've got three great speakers lined up who are going to talk about cloud computing and its environmental impact:</p>

<li><strong>Andy Piper, <a href="https://www.vmware.com/uk/">VMware</a></strong>: Cloud Foundry, the open source cloud computing platform</li>
</ul>


<p>Talks will be finished by 9, so we'll be heading to a nearby pub for a drink and a chat afterwards.</p>

<p>Places are limited, so <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/83832832/">sign up now</a> to avoid disappointment!</p>
